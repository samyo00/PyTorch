Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™ve been diving deep into the PyTorch framework, which has become my go-to tool for building and experimenting with neural networks. After following Patrick Loeberâ€™s PyTorch tutorial playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4 Iâ€™ve created a series of projects that showcase what Iâ€™ve learned and my progress in the field.

ðŸ§  What Iâ€™ve Been Learning

*PyTorch framework for deep learning
*Building and training neural networks from scratch
*Computer vision and NLP applications
*Optimization techniques to enhance model performance
*Implementing transfer learning and fine-tuning with pre-trained models
